# signalk-hlp-bms-plugin

The plugin reads  data from the HLP BMS and publish it as signalK paths. 

There are still things to do:
- make the parsing av temperatures more robust and allow for multiple temperarute sensors



Fixed since last Release 
- replace console.log commands to debug commands
- add meta data so correct units are sent to signalK
