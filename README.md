# signalk-hlp-bms-plugin

The plugin reads  data from the HLP BMS and publish it as signalK paths. 

There are still things to do:
- make the parsing of temperatures more robust and allow for multiple temperarute sensors
- include a setting to let the user select path name(s)
- replace console.log commands to debug commands or remove consooe comands in serial.js


Fixed since last Release 
- add meta data so correct units are sent to signalK
